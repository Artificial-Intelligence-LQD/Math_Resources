## Dive into Deep Learning

An interactive deep learning book with code, math, and discussions, based on the NumPy interface by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, and Alexander J. Smola. With 900 pages, this seems to be one of the most comprehensive one-stop resources that goes from Linear Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptrons all the way to modern Deep Learning architectures including Attention Mechanisms and Optimization Algorithms – giving you all three: Theory, Math & Code.

## 3blue1brown

3blue1brown, by Grant Sanderson, is some combination of math and entertainment, depending on your disposition. The goal is for explanations to be driven by animations and for difficult problems to be made simple with changes in perspective.
